            This site was created for a web development class at Washington State University. The goal of the project
            is to create an in browser rogue like dungeon crawler for desktop browsers. This project is currently being developed
            by Luke Darrow and David Hoekman.

        <h2>Core Gameplay:</h2>
        <p>
            We have a lot of ideas for what we will include in our game. The major insperation was to create something
            similar to the game Hammerwatch, with additional features. We plan to have a top down view much like Hammerwatch
            as pictured below.
        </p>

            <img src="HWPic.jpg" alt="Hammerwatch Image" style="width:720px;height:406px;margin:5px 5px 25px 25px;" title="Hammerwatch">

        <p>
            The game will run in real time with free movement, and combat. The dungeons themselves will be generated randomly.
            We plan on including are having XP that will award
            chooseable stat upgrades. This will allow for a feeling of progression throughout the game, and
            will also allow us to scale enemies as the game goes along.
            The game would
            be a roguelike of sorts with a two dimensional world and combat similar to Hammerwatch. It will
            be like a roguelike with stats and experience that don’t carry over into new dungeon runs as
            each run is unique.
        </p>
        <p>
            There will be at least three different classes of playable characters. A
            warrior that has a bit more health, average damage, and a sweeping sword attack. A rogue that
            has lower than average health, above average damage, and a poking attack. Lastly a wizard
            with average health, and average damage, with a ranged attack.
        </p>

        <p>
            We also have some stretch goals that we want to get to do, but may not be able to. We have
            thought of including item pick ups that could affect your stats, such as increasing movement
            speed, or even change the way your character attacks, such as making your attacks bigger.
            Another stretch goal we thought of is creating a seed input so you can replay a dungeon if you
            want to, or keep the seed for an interesting dungeon you want to show others. One last stretch
            goal would to make the game co-op, to allow multiple people to team up in the dungeons
